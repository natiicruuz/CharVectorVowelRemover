# CharVectorVowelRemover
Char Vector Creator And Vowel Eliminator

The program is designed to take a string input - "Este es mi primer ejercicio" - and store it in a variable. It then splits the string into individual characters and inserts them into a character array (also known as a char vector).

Next, the program removes all instances of the vowel "i" from the character array and concatenates the remaining characters back into a single string.

Finally, the resulting string is printed to the console and a unit test is performed to verify the program's correct functionality.
